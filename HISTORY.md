# JellyScout Plugin Development History

## What We Tried

We attempted to create a Jellyfin plugin to integrate BitPlay streaming as a Live TV channel.

### v0.0.2 - Started with Media Management
- Built a comprehensive plugin with Sonarr/Radarr integration
- Added catalog pages and streaming features
- Realized this was too complex for what we needed

### v0.1.9 - Switched to Live TV
- Implemented `ILiveTvService` interface
- Created Channel 2001 for BitPlay streaming
- Added program guide for 24-hour streaming
- Channel worked but wasn't visible in Live TV interface

### v0.1.10 - Added User-Specific Channels
- Used SHA256 hashing to generate unique channel numbers from user IDs
- Channel range 2100-2999 (user `4632e69256a643c0852dad5564682c6d` got Channel 2998)
- Still couldn't see channels in Live TV

### v0.1.11 - Built Web Interface
- Added configuration page with channel cards
- Created API endpoints for channel information
- Made "Watch Channel X" buttons
- Got "no settings to set up" error

### v0.1.12 - Fixed Configuration
- Added embedded resources properly
- Fixed configuration page access
- Still had constructor errors

### v0.1.13 - Final Fix
- Fixed constructor error by separating service registration
- Plugin loaded successfully
- Discovered the real problem: existing Xtream plugin controls all Live TV

## Why It Didn't Work

The user already had an Xtream plugin that completely takes over Jellyfin's Live TV system. Our BitPlay channels couldn't appear because only one Live TV service can control the interface at a time.

## What We Learned

- Jellyfin's Live TV system only allows one service to be in control
- When another plugin already manages Live TV, new channels can't be added
- The plugin worked technically but couldn't integrate with the existing setup
- Project was discontinued because it couldn't achieve the main goal
